# PyBer_Analysis

## Objective
The purpose of this project was to examine data from the ride service company PyBer, and analyze the the disparities in data based on the different city types.

## Results
### Rural Cities
- Total number of rides for rural cities are 125
- Total number of drivers for rural cities are 78 
- Total fares for rural cities are $4,327.93 
- Average fare per ride is $34.62 
- Average fare per driver is $55.49

### Suburban Cities
- Total number of rides for suburban cities are 625
- Total number of drivers for suburban cities are 490
- Total fares for suburban cities are $19,356.33
- Average fare per ride is $30.97 
- Average fare per driver is $39.50

### Urban Cities
- Total number of rides for urban cities are 1625
- Total number of drivers for urban cities are 2405 
- Total fares for urban cities are $39,854.38
- Average fare per ride is $24.53 
- Average fare per driver is $16.57

Of the three city types, urban cities grossed the most money in total fares for rides, while rural cities made the least. As one might expected, urban cities also ranked highest for the total number of rides and total drivers, suburban cities ranked second, and rural cities ranked third in those respective categories. However, rural cities average fare per ride and average fare per driver were considerably higher than both suburban and urban cities, with urban cities containing the lowest average fares in the afformentiationed categories.

## Summary
Based on the analysis it would appear that although the total number of rides for rural cities are the lowest, their average price per ride is the highest. This may be in part due to a smaller population in these areas, and consequently less need for the service, but there may be additional contributing factors such as lack of drivers and affordable pricing. There are three potential options to consider that would help address these concerns. First, a ride sharing feature could be created wherein customers can carpool/share their ride with other people in their area to help bring down the average fare price. Second, could be to offer an incentive program for more drivers to join. The final option would be to assess the overall need for a ride service company like PyBer to continue to operate in rural areas, and consider removing it entirely to better focus efforts on suburban and urban cities.
